K-Means Clustering Algorithms

1: Implement the k-means algorithm. Your implementation should ini-
tialize points by assigning each point to a cluster at random. Your implementation
should iterate until the algorithm converges (i.e. no cluster assignments change from
one iteration to the next). 

2: Use your algorithms to cluster the Fashion-MNIST dataset (which you
used in Homework3). You may try a range of k values from 5 to 15 and validate your
results using RAND index and adjusted RAND index and summarize your results in a
Table . What is the best value of k in terms of RAND index and adjusted
RAND index? You can use Euclidean distance as distance function. You may
use the existing implementations of RAND indices without penalty.

3: Run your algorithm 5 times over the Fashion-MNIST dataset (with the
best k value you get from Question 2), each time using a different initialization. Report
your results sing RAND index and adjusted RAND index for each time. 

4: Write a paragraph to conclude what you get during experiments.
